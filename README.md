Gelasio is an original typeface which is metrics compatible with Georgia in its Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic weights. Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold and SemiBold Italic have now been added as well but these don't have equivalents in Georgia at the time of writing.

Notes:

• This design will retain the purpose of being metrics compatible with Georgia in Regular and Bold weights while expanding somewhat past what Georgia can do in some areas such as having case sensitive punctuation and a few more numbers styles.

• However to remain a fuctional match to Georgia, Gelasio will not include kerning.

• The new Georgia found in Windows 10 ( in 2018 ) has some features and glyphs not present in Gelasio such as support for Greek and Cyrillic, Small caps for all three scripts and some additional symbols, and box drawing glyphs. Later I hope to make Gelsio fully equivalent in these ways as well.

•  I also hope to make a font based on this work with a new name that is
 - not metrics compatible with Georgia
 - is a variable font
 - has kerning
 - is tuned to contemporary screen use rather than the relatively low resoution (72 dpi and 96 dpi) screens typical of mid-90s.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://SorkinType.github.io/Gelasio.
